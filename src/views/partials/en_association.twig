        <h3>A programme devoted to revealing architectural masterpieces in a conversation with contemporary creation</h3>

        <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
        <p>Genius Loci is a not-for profit association under French law (1901 act) established in 2021 by Marion Vignal, curator and author specializing in contemporary art, design and architecture. The association is devoted to the promotion of architectural heritage and contemporary creation. Hidden or little-known architectural gems are brought to light and access is given exceptionally to private venues ordinarily closed to the public, enabling wider knowledge and discovery. The unveiling of such venues is orchestrated to resonate with contemporary creative arts so as to bring the spirit of a place back to life.</p>
        <p>The Genius Loci association promotes artists and designers by providing a personal, intimate perspective of their work and history through its program of exhibitions in venues chosen for their singular architectural noteworthiness. </p>
        <p>Breaking down barriers between artistic genres and building bridges between the past and the present, heritage and modernity, each exhibition brings together artists of different expressive modes – from visual arts, to olfaction, music and digital art.</p>
        <p>With its experiential exhibitions, the Genius Loci association seeks to bring architecture to life in an emotion-filled sensory approach that aims to reveal the inner identity of a masterpiece. Visits of the exhibitions are open to all, by reservation and are aimed at as wide an audience as possible.</p>

        <h2>EXPERIENTIAL EXHIBITIONS</h2>
        <p>Genius Loci is an exclusive series of immersive exhibitions setting up a dialogue between architecture, design and contemporary art. Each edition offers an inside view of a private residence of exceptional artistic note, revealing the spirit of the place through artworks and especially commissioned works inspired by the personality of its creator and the creative genius resonating within the venue.</p>
        <p>Conceived as an emotion-filled stroll, Genius Loci woos the public into a here and now that summons all the senses. An intimate experience of sight, sound and olfaction which draws its origins from the architecture and its enduring thought. Genius Loci is an international and itinerant project designed by Marion Vignal and carried out by the association that bears its name.</p>
